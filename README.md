How to Play

Objective:

The objective is to discover your opponent’s hidden treasures while protecting your own. The game consists of three turns, with two Shop Phases between them, where players can purchase items to aid in their strategy.

Game Setup:

 • Each player starts with 50 gold, 10 shovels, and four chests (1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 1x3).
 • Players also have a unique passive ability based on their chosen avatar.

Phases of the Game:

 1. Hide Phase (20 seconds):
 • Players place their treasures and any traps they may have purchased on their grid.
 • The grid represents your coastline, where you’ll strategically hide your chests to avoid detection by the opponent.
 2. Seek Phase (50 seconds):
 • Players take turns using shovels to dig on the opponent’s grid, attempting to find hidden treasures.
 • Each dig consumes one shovel.
 • If you find a chest, you earn the corresponding gold amount:
 • 1x1 Chest: 20 gold
 • 2x1 Chest: 30 gold
 • 1x2 Chest: 35 gold
 • 1x3 Chest: 50 gold
 • Traps will deduct one shovel if activated.
 • A minimum of 3 shovels is provided at the start of each Seek Phase if a player runs out of gold.

 3. Shop Phase (20 seconds):
 • After each Seek Phase, players can use their gold to purchase items:
 • Shovels: 15 gold each.
 • Traps: 20 gold each.
 • Abilities: 45 gold each (varies based on your avatar).
 • Rebuild Chests: Costs vary depending on chest size:
 • 1x1 Chest: 15 gold
 • 2x1 Chest: 20 gold
 • 1x2 Chest: 25 gold
 • 1x3 Chest: 35 gold
 • Rebuilt chests can be hidden again during the next Hide Phase.
 4. Final Tiebreaker (if needed):
 • If both players have similar scores after the three turns, a tiebreaker round will occur. Players will use their remaining resources in a sudden-death round to determine the winner.

Winning the Game:

 • The player who uncovers the most valuable treasures or successfully defends their treasures while strategically rebuilding and protecting their chests wins the game.
